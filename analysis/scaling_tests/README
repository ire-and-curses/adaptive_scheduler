scaling tests - A set of experiments to measure scheduling scaling performance
Eric Saunders, July 2013

matrix.dat  - Size of the matrices being sent to the LP solver.
timings.dat - Measured run-time of each function.

Test 1 - timings_1.dat, matrix_sizes_1.dat
------
A one week scheduling horizon.
Fully random target coordinates.
All targets have a full user window, to the horizon (actual window depends on coords).
One continuous scheduling run (no CTRL-C).
No dirty flag setting without adding more Requests.


Test 2 - timings_2.dat, matrix_sizes_2.dat
------
Rerunning the input load at the end of test 1.
155 Requests in. Kernel saw 141 after filtering.
Strange timing results point to cache coherency issue in memoizing (fractional rounding?).
Wildly varying numbers of submissions point to ongoing unknown bug.
CPU time of schedeule_all() is reliable; all others are suspect.


Test 3 - timings_3.dat, matrix_sizes_3.dat
------
Rerun of Test 1, now memoizing is fixed.

Test 4
------
A one week scheduling horizon.
Fully random target coordinates.
One target has a full user window, to the horizon.
Rise_set visibility calculations disabled throughout.
All other targets have one day windows.
One continuous scheduling run (no CTRL-C).
No dirty flag setting without adding more Requests.
