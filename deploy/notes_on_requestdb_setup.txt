After installing the RequestDB using the script in this directory, there are
additional steps needed to make the system functional.

1) Create mysql databases for the RequestDB ('scheduler_requests') and rbauth ('rbauth')
2) Add rbauth to the list of installed apps in the RequestDB server's settings.py
3) python manage.py syncdb --database=rbauth
4) python manage.py syncdb --database=requestdb
5) python manage.py migrate proposaldb
6) python manage.py migrate requestdb

7) Run the server: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001
8) Submit requests. Requests won't be accepted unless you have a valid proposal which
also has time allocated.
