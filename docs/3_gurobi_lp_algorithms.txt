What's in Gurobi?
    Automatic presolve
        - for both LP and MIP

    Algorithms for continuous optimization
        - Simplex
        - Barrier (interior point)

    Algorithms for discrete optimization
        - branch-and-bound



Presolve
    Goal is to reduce problem size
        Remove redundant constraints
        Substition to remove unnecessary variables



Simplex is numerically very stable
Barrier is highly parallelisable
Concurrent optimisation in Gurobi
    Run both simplex and barrier concurrently
    Solution reported by first one to finish
    Use multiple CPU cores - best mix of speed and robustness



To solve an LP to optimality, must satisfy KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) conditions
    - if satisfied this is a proof of optimality

    Primal simplex and Dual simplex maintain different two out of three
    conditions, then tries to resolve the third

    Barrier doesn't maintain anything


Warm start
    Simplex can be 1000x faster with correct warm start
    Barrier can be 0.3x faster with correct warm start
    Warm start is crucial for MIP
