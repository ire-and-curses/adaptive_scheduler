pond.py - Facade to the pond_client library.

This module provides the scheduler's interface for constructing POND objects.
It maps objects across domains from 1) -> 2) (described below).

1) A complete scheduled observation in this facade needs the following:
    * A ScheduledBlock made up of
            * A Metadata object
        * One or more Molecules, each made up of
            * A set of Molecule-specific parameters
            * A Target, if applicable


2) A complete scheduled observation in the POND needs the following:
    * A ScheduledBlock made up of
        * One or more Observations, each made up of
            * A set of Observation-specific parameters
            * A Pointing, if applicable


Meta information about Observations is added by means of Group objects.
